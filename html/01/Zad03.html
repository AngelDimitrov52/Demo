    <h1> Egyptian Mau </h1>
<h2> Egyptian Maus are a small- to medium-sized short-haired cat breed.</h2>
<p> Along with the Bahraini Dilmun cat, they are one of the few naturally spotted 
breeds of domesticated cat.</p> <p> The spots of the Mau occur on only the tips of the 
hairs of its coat. It is considered to be a rare breed.

 The breed conformation is described as "a balance between the 
    compactness of a Burmese and the slim elegance of a Siamese.</p>
